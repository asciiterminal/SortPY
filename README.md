# SortPY
This tool was developed using ChatGPT

This program creates a graphical user interface (GUI) with a single button using the tkinter library. When the button is clicked, it opens a file dialog that allows the user to select a CSV file. The program then reads the CSV file, asks the user for a sort key and sort order, and sorts the data using the custom sort_data function. Finally, the program asks the user for an output file format (either CSV or TXT) and writes the sorted data to a file in the specified format using the tkinter file
